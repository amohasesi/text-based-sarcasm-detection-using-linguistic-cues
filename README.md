# Text-based Sarcasm Detection Using Linguistic Cues

## Overview

This project analyzes sarcastic and non-sarcastic news headlines from The Onion and HuffPost in Python to identify key features predictive of sarcastic news headlines and builds logistic regression, random forest, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network classification models to predict sarcastic news headlines with high accuracy.

## Key Feautures 

- Feature engineering: Uses natural language processing techniques for feature extraction
- Model Building: Develops logistic regression, random forest, and MLP neural network classification models
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Uses cross-validated grid search to optimize model performance 
- Visualization: Plots confusion matrices and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to evaluate and compare model performance
